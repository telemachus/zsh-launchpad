# Z Shell Launchpad üöÄ
A simple dotfiles template to kick-start/bootstrap your `zsh` config and start
learning how to get the most out of your shell.

## Installation
1. Download and extract [this Zip
   file](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-launchpad/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. In your terminal:
   1. `cd` to the directory created by the above.
   1. Run `make`.
1. Close your current terminal tab/window and open a new one.

## What is this? What are its goals?
* It‚Äôs a fully functional set of dotfiles that works out of the box. Its goal
  is to help you be productive with Zsh right off the bat.
* It‚Äôs a template for you to customize to your own liking. Its goal is to give
  you a solid basis for your own Zsh, but without filling in details that are
  outside the scope of Zsh itself.
* It‚Äôs an educational tool with lots of examples and lots of comments to help
  you understand what the heck is going on. Its goal is to be a springboard for
  you to start your journey into learning Zsh, with plenty of links pointing
  you to further reading.

However, this is _not_ a finished product or a fire-and-forget piece of
software with a fixed API. Rather, you‚Äôre supposed to read it through and learn
from it, then use the knowledge you‚Äôve gained to tailor it to your own needs.

It is, however, opinionated. It gives you what _I_ think is a solid set of
sensible defaults and deliberately does not delve into topics that I think are
better solved by using good plugins.

## Who is this for? Is it right for me?
This template is for those who
* want to have a ready-made config so they can get started with Zsh right away
  _and_
* want to actually learn how to write Zsh code and make the most of Zsh‚Äôs many
  features.

There is currently no alternative for new Zsh users that solidly checks both of
these boxes. Oh-My-Zsh and other ‚Äúframeworks‚Äù cater to those who strongly want
the former, but don't give you any of the latter. Zsh itself also fails in this
regard. On one end, its [new user
wizard](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/master/Functions/Newuser/zsh-newuser-install)
_tries_ to give you the former, but, rather than give you decent defaults,
forces you to choose from a wide array of confusing options and leaves you with
a poorly-documented config full of magic values. On the other end, its [_An
Introduction to the Z
Shell_](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Intro/intro_toc.html) _tries_ to give you
the latter, but rather than being hands-on, presents you with endless lists of
abstract examples without clear, practical uses and hasn't been updated since
1995.

There is clearly a gap in the offerings for new Zsh users. This template is for
those who occupy that niche.

However, it does assume you already know how to program. It‚Äôs not going to
teach you that.
